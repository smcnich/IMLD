# file: $NEDC_NFC/util/python/nedc_imld/v4.0.0/algo_params_v00.toml
#
# A parameter file that defines key paramaters for algorithms.
#

# this parameter file houses all of the palgorithms in ML Tools
# and shows how to define them in a way the IMLD GUI can read them.
# please follow the following format to ensure the GUI can properly
# process the algorithms:
#
# [ALGORITHM_NAME]
#   name = "Algorithm Name"
#   [ALGORITHM_NAME.params]
#       [ALGORITHM_NAME.params.PARAM_NAME]
#           name = "Parameter Name"
#           type = "select" or "int" or "float" or "class-based"
#           range = [0, 1] # only for int or float
#           options = ["option1", "option2", ...] # only for select
#           default = "option1" or 0.0 or 1
#           description = "This is a description of the parameter."
#       ...
#
# make sure the ALGORITHM_NAME matches up to the algorithm name in
# ML Tools. also, make sure to include the algorithm name in the
# LIST variable at the top of this file.
#
# the parameter values of 'name', 'type', 'default', and 'description'
# are all required. depending on the type of parameter, the following
# attributes are required:
#
# - 'options' is required for type "select"
#   - if you would like to have parameter that the user cannot change,
#     simply set the options to a single value
# - 'range' is required for type "int" or "float"
#   - if you would like an infinite range, use "inf" as the upper bound
# - if the type is 'classed-based', there is no need for a 'range' or 'select'.
#   the parser will generate a integer input for each of the classes present
#   in the data. the default value will show for each of these integer inputs.
#   (please see 'EUCLIDEAN' for an example)

# set version information
