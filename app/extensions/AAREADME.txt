file: nedc_imld/app/extensions/AAREADME.txt

This directory contains all of the extensions that are used by the Flask.
These extensions are used to add functionality to the Flask server, such as
the routes, scheduling, and the base Flask app.

The extensions in this directory are:

- base.py:
   This file contains the base Flask app that is used to create the Flask
   server. It is used to create the Flask app and its configurations. This
   file is used by /app/__init__.py to load the base Flask app.

- bluepinrint.py:
   This file contains the blueprint for the Flask app. It is used to create
   the routes for the Flask app. This file is used by /app/__init__.py to
   load the blueprint for the Flask app. All of the routes for the Flask app
   are defined in this file.

- scheduler.py:
   This file contains the scheduler for the Flask app. It is used to create
   the scheduler for the Flask app. This file is used by /app/__init__.py to
   load the scheduler for the Flask app. The scheduler is used to schedule
   the task of removing old cached models from the server.

All of these extensions are called in the /app/__init__.py file, which combines
all of the extensions into a single IMLD application class, which is called by
/imld.py.
